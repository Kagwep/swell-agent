Then there's the L1 data availability fee, which is a portion of the cost to post transaction data to Ethereum. The L1 portion fluctuates with Ethereum gas prices, but it's shared across many transactions in a batch, so it's much cheaper than direct Ethereum interactions. Overall, you're looking at maybe 5-10% of what you'd pay on Ethereum mainnet. If you really want to optimize, submit transactions when Ethereum gas prices are low (weekends typically) since that affects the L1 component.",

If Optimism develops a zk-proving system for the OP Stack, Swellchain could theoretically adopt it.
